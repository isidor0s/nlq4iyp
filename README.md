# NLQ4IYP

NLQ4IYP is a Streamlit web interface that lets anyone query the Internet Yellow Pages (IYP) Neo4j knowledge graph using natural language. Each user supplies their own Google AI Studio (Gemini) API key; the app translates questions into Cypher via LangGraph + MCP tools and shows the generated queries/results for validation.
